# Fedora images for the Rock64

Currently this repository is empty (of any actual code and is just being used as a placeholder in order to use Github for image releases.

Root filesystem(s) from [kraxel.org](https://www.kraxel.org/repos/images/).

Everything else (kernel, partition structure, boot parameters, etc) from [ayufan's linux-build images](https://github.com/ayufan-rock64/linux-build/releases).

## How to use

Just flash the image to an SD card with your tool of choice (dd, Win32DiskImager, etc). 

To login, use rock64/rock64. Root password is also "rock64". **Do not forget to change these passwords if your R64 will be network-accessible to others!**
